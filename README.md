# YGO Agent

YGO Agent is a project to create a Yu-Gi-Oh! AI using deep learning (LLMs, RL). It consists of a game environment and a set of AI agents.

## News

- April 18, 2024: We have fully switched to JAX for training and evaluation. Check the evaluation sections for more details and try the new JAX-trained agents.

- April 14, 2024: LSTM has been implemented and well tested. See `scripts/jax/ppo.py` for more details.

- April 7, 2024: We have switched to JAX for training and evaluation due to the better performance and flexibility. The scripts are in the `scripts/jax` directory. The documentation is in progress. PyTorch scripts are still available in the `scripts` directory, but they are not maintained.

## Subprojects

### ygoenv
`ygoenv` is a high performance game environment for Yu-Gi-Oh! It is initially inspired by [yugioh-ai](https://github.com/melvinzhang/yugioh-ai]) and [yugioh-game](https://github.com/tspivey/yugioh-game), and now implemented on top of [envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool).

### ygoai
`ygoai` is a set of AI agents for playing Yu-Gi-Oh! It aims to achieve superhuman performance like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, with or without human knowledge. Currently, we focus on using reinforcement learning to train the agents.


## Building

The following building instructions are only tested on Ubuntu (WSL2) and may not work on other platforms.

To build the project, you need to install the following prerequisites first:
- gcc 10+ or clang 11+
- CMake 3.12+
- [xmake](https://xmake.io/#/getting_started)
- jax 0.4.25+, flax 0.8.2+, distrax 0.1.5+ (CUDA is optional)

After that, you can build with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbl1996/ygo-agent.git
cd ygo-agent
git checkout stable  # switch to the stable branch
xmake f -y
make
```

After building, you can run the following command to test the environment. If you see episode logs, it means the environment is working. Try more usage in the next section!

```bash
cd scripts
python -u eval.py --env-id "YGOPro-v0" --deck ../assets/deck/  --num_episodes 32 --strategy random  --lang chinese --num_envs 16
```

### Common Issues

#### Package version not found by xmake
Delete `repositories`, `cache`, `packages` directories in the `~/.xmake` directory and run `xmake f -y` again.

#### Install packages failed with xmake
Sometimes you may fail to install the required libraries by xmake automatically (e.g., `glog` and `gflags`). You can install them manually (e.g., `apt install`) and put them in the search path (`$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or others), then xmake will find them.

#### GLIBC and GLIBCXX version conflict
Mostly, it is because your `libstdc++` from `$CONDA_PREFIX` is older than the system one, while xmake compiles libraries with the system one and you run programs with the `$CONDA_PREFIX` one. If so, you can delete the old `libstdc++` from `$CONDA_PREFIX` (backup it first) and make a soft link to the system one.

#### Other xmake issues
Open a new terminal and try again. God bless you.


## Evaluation

### Obtain a trained agent

We provide trained agents in the [releases](https://github.com/sbl1996/ygo-agent/releases/tag/v0.1). Check these Flax checkpoint files named with `{commit_hash}_{exp_id}_{step}.flax_model` and download (the lastest) one to your local machine. The following usage assumes you have it.

If you are not in the `stable` branch or encounter any other running issues, you can try to switch to the `commit_hash` commit before using the agent. You may need to rebuild the project after switching:

```bash
xmake f -c
xmake b -r ygopro_ygoenv
```

### Play against the agent

We can use `eval.py` to play against the trained agent with a MUD-like interface in the terminal. We add `--xla_device cpu` to run the agent on the CPU.

```bash
python -u eval.py --deck ../assets/deck --lang chinese --xla_device cpu --checkpoint checkpoints/350c29a_7565_6700M.flax_model --play
```

We can enter `quit` to exit the game. Run `python eval.py --help` for more options, for example, `--player 0` to make the agent play as the first player, `--deck1 TenyiSword` to force the first player to use the TenyiSword deck.


### Battle between two agents

We can use `battle.py` to let two agents play against each other and find out which one is better.

```bash
python -u battle.py --deck ../assets/deck --checkpoint1 checkpoints/350c29a_7565_6700M.flax_model --checkpoint2 checkpoints/350c29a_1166_6200M.flax_model --num-episodes 32 --num_envs 8 --seed 0
```

We can set `--record` to generate `.yrp` replay files to the `replay` directory. The `yrp` files can be replayed in YGOPro compatible clients (YGOPro, YGOPro2, KoishiPro, MDPro). Change `--seed` to generate different games.

```bash
python -u battle.py --deck ../assets/deck --xla_device cpu --checkpoint1 checkpoints/350c29a_7565_6700M.flax_model --checkpoint2 checkpoints/350c29a_1166_6200M.flax_model --num-episodes 16 --record --seed 0
```


## Training (Deprecated, to be updated)

Training an agent requires a lot of computational resources, typically 8x4090 GPUs and 128-core CPU for a few days. We don't recommend training the agent on your local machine. Reducing the number of decks for training may reduce the computational resources required.

### Single GPU Training

We can train the agent with a single GPU using the following command:

```bash
python -u ppo.py --deck ../assets/deck --seed 1 --embedding_file embed.pkl \
--minibatch-size 128 --learning-rate 1e-4 --update-epochs 2  --save_interval 100 \
--compile reduce-overhead --env_threads 16 --num_envs 64 --eval_episodes 32
```

#### Deck
`deck` can be a directory containing `.ydk` files or a single `.ydk` file (e.g., `deck/` or `deck/BlueEyes.ydk`). The well tested and supported decks are in the `assets/deck` directory.

Supported cards are listed in `scripts/code_list.txt`. New decks which only contain supported cards can be used, but errors may also occur due to the complexity of the game.

#### Embedding
To handle the diverse and complex card effects, we have converted the card information and effects into text and used large language models (LLM) to generate embeddings from the text. The embeddings are stored in a file (e.g., `embed.pkl`).

We provide one in the [releases](https://github.com/sbl1996/ygo-agent/releases/tag/v0.1), which named `embed{n}.pkl` where `n` is the number of cards in `code_list.txt`.

You can choose to not use the embeddings by skip the `--embedding_file` option. If you do it, remember to set `--num_embeddings` to `999` in the `eval.py` script.

#### Compile
We use `torch.compile` to speed up the overall training process. It is very important and can reduce the overall time by 2x or more. If the compilation fails, you may update the PyTorch version to the latest one.

#### Seed
The `seed` option is used to set the random seed for reproducibility. However, many optimizations used in the training are not deterministic, so the results may still vary.

For debugging, you can set `--compile None --torch-deterministic` with the same seed to get a deterministic result.

#### Hyperparameters
More PPO hyperparameters can be found in the `ppo.py` script. Tuning them may improve the performance but requires more computational resources.


### Distributed Training

The `ppo.py` script supports single-node and multi-node distributed training with `torchrun`. Start distributed training like this:

```bash
# single node
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=8 ppo.py \

# multi node on nodes 0
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 torchrun --nnodes=2 --nproc-per-node=8 --node-rank=0 \
--rdzv-id=12941 --master-addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master-port=$MASTER_PORT ppo.py \
# multi node on nodes 1
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 torchrun --nnodes=2 --nproc-per-node=8 --node-rank=1 \
--rdzv-id=12941 --master-addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master-port=$MASTER_PORT ppo.py \


# script options
--deck ../assets/deck --seed 1 --embedding_file embed.pkl \
--minibatch-size 2048 --learning-rate 5e-4 --update-epochs 2 --save_interval 100 \
--compile reduce-overhead --env_threads 128 --num_envs 1024 --eval_episodes 128
```

The script options are mostly the same as the single GPU training. We only scale the batch size and the number of environments to the number of available CPUs and GPUs. The learning rate is then scaled according to the batch size.
